# 📉 Expiry-Day Straddle Strategy on NIFTY: Realistic Backtesting Framework

A realistic and robust backtesting framework for intraday expiry-day short straddle strategies on NIFTY options, simulating market behavior using historical spot data, Black-Scholes pricing, and dynamic implied volatility. This project eliminates the need for expensive historical option chain data by realistically generating option prices and bid-ask spreads.

## 📌 Objective

To simulate and analyze a disciplined expiry-day short straddle strategy under realistic market conditions, allowing for:
- Accurate replication of NIFTY expiry-day option price behavior
- Entry/exit logic under time, volatility, and momentum constraints
- Risk-aware and regime-sensitive trade execution

---

## 🔍 Core Strategy

- **Instrument**: NIFTY ATM Options  
- **Setup**: Short Straddle (Sell ATM Call + Put)
- **When**: Thursdays (Expiry Days)  
- **Entry Times Tested**: `10:00 AM`, `11:00 AM`, `12:00 PM`  
- **Best Entry**: `12:00 PM` consistently yielded better results

---

## ⚙️ Key Features

- ✅ **Entry Criteria**:
  - Implied Volatility (IV) < 20%
  - Minimum 1.5 hours left to expiry
  - No entry if strong directional movement (momentum filter)

- 🎯 **Exit Criteria**:
  - Profit Target: 40% of premium
  - Stop Loss: 180% of premium
  - IV Contraction or Max Holding Time: 45 minutes

- 📊 **Volatility Regime-Based Position Sizing**:
  - Adjust lot sizes for low, normal, high IV, and VIX spike regimes

- 💡 **Realistic Simulation**:
  - Black-Scholes pricing with dynamic IV
  - Simulated bid-ask spreads & slippage
  - Intraday volatility adjustment

## 📈 Backtest Metrics & Visualizations

All trades are tracked and analyzed with the following:
- Win Rate
- ROI & Average Return
- Sharpe Ratio
- Maximum Drawdown
- Volatility Regime–specific performance

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Language**: Python  
- **Libraries**: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, `seaborn`
